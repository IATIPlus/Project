# Sample Questions Library

This final work area is dedicated to building a comprehensive library of sample questions to validate the database and test AI applications.

Volunteers will focus on the end-to-end query process: from translating complex, natural-language questions into executable Cypher query statements, to synthesizing the raw data outputs back into meaningful answers. The team will also develop a scalable framework for generating and evaluating these test questions, ensuring they cover a wide vertical and horizontal range of humanitarian and development use cases.
