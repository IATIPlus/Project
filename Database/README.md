# IATI Plus Neo4j Graph Database

This core work area focuses on the database itself. Volunteers will use the day-stamped master XML files stored in the project's **IATI Data Snapshot Repository** to build and continuously update the IATI Plus graph database, keeping it synchronized with the official IATI corpus. The team will also focus on optimizing the graphâ€™s structure for efficient traversal by AI applications and developing guidance on effective query design and best practices.
