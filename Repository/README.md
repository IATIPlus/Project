# Repository for Daily IATI Data Snapshots

IATI makes daily snapshots of its entire XML corpus available for researchers to download directly, each segmented into hundreds of subfolders by publishing organization. **IATI Bulk Data Download** [page](https://bulk-data.iatistandard.org/).

Volunteers are developing an automated data pipeline to fetch and unzip these daily snapshots, and consolidate the thousands of individual XML files they contain into a single, day-stamped master XML file. These master files are archived in a cloud data repository. This process builds a complete longitudinal record, allowing researchers to track data changes over time and compare different historical snapshots in novel ways.
